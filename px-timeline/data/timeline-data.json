When we have an application that we use on a regular basis, we download that application to a smart phone rather than using the browser based version on our mobile browser. Google’s Polymer Project wants to improve the gap between native app performance and mobile web app performance. The key problem with mobile web is that we are sending huge JavaScript bundles to mobile devices, which inhibits performance. The Polymer Project is working to build more functionality into our mobile browsers so that it is easier to load these heavy web applications.",
